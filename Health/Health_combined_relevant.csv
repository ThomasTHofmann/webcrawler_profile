Inventor and entrepreneur.,"Executive Chairman & Founder, Biosplice Therapeutics · Full-time, Mar 2021 - Present · 1 yr 5 mos, San Diego, California, United States, Biosplice Therapeutics is developing first-in-class, small-molecule therapeutics based on pioneering science of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Stemming from foundational discoveries in Wnt pathway modulation, Biosplice has elucidated novel biology linking CLK/DYRK kinases to the therapeutic regulation of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing is an essential biological mechanism that regulates the diversification of proteins in a cell, which, in turn, determines cell type and function. Biosplice’s target class governs the selection of tissue-specific mRNA splice sites, making them attractive, druggable targets within the cellular “command and control” center. Biosplice’s drugs in clinical development include lorecivivint for osteoarthritis (in Phase 3), cirtuvivint for numerous cancers, and a broad pipeline that ranges from Alzheimer’s disease to other degenerative conditions.

"Dr. Matthews seeks to focus on larger health policy issues that impact underserved patient populations - access to care and financing, health disparities, social determinants of health, primary care and the medical home. She is a clinician, advocate, administrator, and academic. Initially having worked in correctional medicine, she transitioned to administration within federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which provide community-based primary care and wrap-around social services. She believes in the FQHC as a meaningful structure for the delivery of care and therefore serves on multiple national and state committees focused on clinical implementation and advocacy issues on behalf of FQHCs.

Having joined the US Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016, she led the newly created Office of Community Care into unprecedented transformation. She successfully implemented the new Veteran Community Care Program under the MISSION Act, deployed the Community Care Network national contracts through the majority of the country, and has transformed the provider claims processing efforts.  Then as Chief Medical Officer of the largest health care system in the world, she assisted with the further transformation of this high quality, high performing integrated network, including serving as the VHA Functional Champion for the EHR Modernization to Cerner commercial product.

With the additional interest in workforce diversity and development, she is former faculty for medical students and residents in both the clinical setting and the classroom. She continues to develop multiple mentoring relationships with students in order to encourage the advancement of future minority physicians, professionals and leaders. With this in mind, along with another young practicing physician, she co-founded the Tour for Diversity in Medicine which seeks to motivate and inspire high school and college students around the nation - visit www.tour4diversity.org for more information.

"We had thought that the Affordable care Act was the greatest transformation in US healthcare since the introduction of Medicare.   
Despite vastly greater access to healthcare coverage, we have not controlled the cost of healthcare nor delivered yet on promises of enhanced outcomes and patient experience.
I have had the privilege to experience the full gamut of the industry from providers to payers, technology developers, scientists and  investors throughout the country and in other parts of the world. 

My focus has always been the continuum of care across the full healthcare spectrum.  The providers of healthcare - physicians, nurses and all others in the delivery chain remain a passion. The leverage of technology as it evolves particularly Virtual Health is top of mind. 

Devoted Health allows me the privilege  and great pleasure to leverage unique leadership, vision, technology and resources to transform healthcare delivery.

Regionalization was a new concept. I was recruited to inaugurate my role and lay the groundwork for a network of physicians with hospitals throughout the enterprise in collaboration with unique partners, Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and Columbia Doctors (CD). Working together, our teams established standardized methodologies for Clinical Service deployment of WCM and CD to our regional network. In addition we initiated numerous hospital programs regionally led by physicians from both schools. The New York Presbyterian Medical Groups (NYPMG) were created and co-branded with WCM and CD in their respective catchment areas as the third physician arm of NYP. The newly formed NYP Physician Services Organization, with a new practice management infrastructure provides practice management services to over 1000 NYPMG providers (850 physicians),including some WCM and CD physicians.

"As CEO and Co-founder of Noom, a consumer-led digital health platform, I have spent 13 years building a passionate team dedicated to our mission of helping people everywhere live healthier lives. Through a powerful combination of human coaching, psychology, and technology, we are empowering our Noomers to take control of their health and change their behaviors for good.

Coming from a family of doctors in South Korea, I have always had an intense desire to help people. From an early age, I knew my life’s work would be dedicated to improving the wellbeing of as many people as possible. After losing my father at a young age, I became more motivated than ever to truly change lives for the better and to channel my entrepreneurial spirit (I founded South Korea’s first-ever heavy metal record label) to make an impact. After dropping out of college and moving to the US, I met my co-founder Artem Petakov, who shared his vision of helping people live healthier lives, and convinced him to leave Google to develop Noom. As CEO, I am responsible for setting the strategic vision for Noom and have led the company through several years of tremendous growth, helping millions of people improve their lifestyles and health. In 2020, I was named EY Entrepreneur of the Year.","Member – Global Innovators Community, World Economic Forum, Mar 2022 - Present · 5 mos, CEO, Co-Founder, Noom Inc., Sep 2006 - Present · 15 yrs 11 mos, New York, United States, Steering Committee Member, Ministry of Science ICT and Future Planning of South Korea, Nov 2013 - Dec 2014 · 1 yr 2 mos, Seoul, Korea, Networking administrator, L.C.

More about me:
I've been interested in the intersection between technology and psychology my whole life. My biggest passion is influencing people's everyday decisions on a large scale, especially in the cases where these decisions will greatly benefit them long-term. Wellness is by far my favorite of these areas.

Here are some fun things not covered below:
* Started programming when I was 9 on an ""Elektronika MK-61"" calculator.
* Grew up in Kiev, Ukraine, moved to U.S. when I was 13.
* Took Daniel Kanheman's ""Psychology of Decision Making"" class at Princeton, making me forever fall in love with psychology of decision-making.
* I love books (Clay Christensen, Andy Grove, Yalom).","Noom Inc., 10 yrs 10 mos, New York, Co-Founder/President, Jan 2015 - Present · 7 yrs 7 mos, Co-Founder/Co-CEO, Oct 2011 - Jan 2015 · 3 yrs 4 mos, Co-Founder/President, Jan 2015 - Present · 7 yrs 7 mos, Co-Founder/Co-CEO, Oct 2011 - Jan 2015 · 3 yrs 4 mos, Co-Founder/President, Jan 2015 - Present · 7 yrs 7 mos, Co-Founder/Co-CEO, Oct 2011 - Jan 2015 · 3 yrs 4 mos, Co-Founder/CTO, WorkSmart Labs (incubator for Noom), Nov 2008 - Oct 2011 · 3 yrs, New York, Software Engineer / Tech Lead, Google, Oct 2005 - Nov 2008 · 3 yrs 2 mos, Founded and later led the GeoSearch project on Google Maps.
