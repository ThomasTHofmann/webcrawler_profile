"Chief Market Officer of 6sense, taking the guesswork out of predictable revenue growth with the power of AI and insights to uncover buyers ready to buy.

Sales, accounting, and consulting are not your typical CMO background, but I’m not your typical CMO. I thrive on variety, challenges, and working with wicked smart people. Creating winning go-to-market strategies, effectively driving change internally and externally, incubating innovation, rocking a sales pitch, relentlessly watching the numbers, and motivating a global team is my perfect “typical day at the office.”

I’m honored to be a part of 6sense, a leading AI-powered account based marketing platform.  As a “recovering software sales woman” I’ve always been keenly focused on leveraging data to ensure marketing programs result in deals, not just leads.  At 6sense, I get to help sales and marketing leaders increase revenue by tapping into the power of predictive intelligence to uncover buyers who are ready to buy. 

Wondering which accounts to target with your marketing investments? Want better engagement from your ABM programs? Tired of of “leads” that never materialize in deals? Having trouble scaling ABM? 

Start by asking yourself do you have the right approach to account selection? Is your technology supporting your efforts? Are you getting into deals early enough? Next reach out to us at 6sense. We will help you consolidate marketing technology into one seamless ABM platform, leverage predictive analytics to target buyers ready to by, and get you into sales cycles 54% earlier for better engagement and win rates.","Chief Market Officer, 6sense, Aug 2018 - Present · 4 yrs, Member, Revenue Collective, Sep 2019 - Present · 2 yrs 11 mos, Greater Chicago Area, Advisory Board Member, Mediafly, Aug 2019 - Present · 3 yrs, Advisory Board Member, Atrium, Jun 2019 - Present · 3 yrs 2 mos, Home, Looking for help in charting your business transformation journey with Artificial Intelligence?

This means infusing experience, sales acumen, and tons of energy into our team, customers, and partnerships in the geography. Additionally I led our stellar global marketing team and go to market strategy as Chief Marketing Officer., Chief Marketing Officer, Jan 2017 - Mar 2018 · 1 yr 3 mos, Greater Chicago Area, Instrumental in aligning sales and marketing under a consistent and relevant message - resulting in increased bookings, average deal size, and win rates. My metrics driven approach resulted in 5X more effective field marketing programs and an increase in inbound leads by 300%., Senior Vice President of Global Marketing , Oct 2015 - Jan 2017 · 1 yr 4 mos, Every tech start up dreams of “the successful exit”, imagine getting “the exit”, being an integral part of making it happen, and the acquisition being on record as one of the most successful in the space?! It’s called a dream come true. I was part of a very small team of executives supporting Appirio’s acquisition process and took point on all internal and external communications across Appirio and Wipro. A major driver for Wipro’s desire to acquire Appirio was our brand and GTM. The cornerstone of our GTM was a big shift I lead with the help of my VP of brand. The cloud ecosystem had evolved--clients wanted more than just cloud technology, they wanted outcomes. As the SVP of marketing, I brought the entire marketing function under a consistent messaging platform centered around creating customer & worker experience outcomes. This provided focus, consistency, differentiation, and thrill of creating a category. It was a massive effort to overhaul all our assets while building critical mass of new ones to support the strategy. Thank goodness it worked! We saw win rates soar, deal sizes grow, and a big ROI lift across all our marketing programs. For example, we had 200% increase in A.V.E. (ad value equivalent) and 50% increase in spend ROI. Launching our thought leadership platform was not just a marketing effort though – I knew we could not do it alone. We had to start a movement! The first step in that movement was to win our sales team and the best way to get them jazzed is SKO. We dramatically up-leveled the SKO program, content, and energy level. We launched a certification program to make sure every field Appirian could confidently tell our new story. Next we took the show on the road with our first thought leadership tour. Executing a 6-city tour in partnership with sales, partners, and our customers. The program was so successful we've expanded it every year and it's a critical part of our marketing, sales and alliances program., VP Demand Generation, Field, and Enablement, Jan 2015 - Sep 2015 · 9 mos, Greater Chicago Area, I feel honored that Appirio asked me to try my hat at marketing. It was an unexpected yet career defining move. As a recovering software sales gal one of the first things I did was establish quotas. This allowed us to really start to change the marketing culture and conversation to be much more ROI and results driven. The team stepped up and we dramatically increased sourced pipeline and generated 5X the ROI from our field programs. Coming from sales I could bridge the gap between marketing and sales to ensure our content machine was effective and relevant. We also established a much tighter partnership with sales around our biggest program – Dreamforce! Together we re-vamped preparation protocols, enablement, and onsite productivity tracking which yielded a 7X increase in ROI. Please don’t ask about the “snoop dogg situation” Let’s just say I weathered that crisis with the help of our CFO, VP of Comms, and General Council I continued to develop and grow our inside sale team and approach. We focused on going from an SDR program to a true inside sales quota bearing function. Last, I was fortunate enough to make my first trip to India. I was hosting a big customer visit and immediately realised what an amazing asset we had in Jaipur. We quickly created a marketing function in India to support a variety of demand generation activities. This gave us scale, time zone coverage, and an influx of energetic new Appirio marketers. Today the team is a key supporting function for sales operations, marketing and alliances., Area Vice President of Sales, Oct 2014 - Jan 2015 · 4 mos, Central, TOLA, West, PNW, As the AVP of the West I had multiple geographies under my responsibility - Central, TOLA, West and Pacific Northwest. I had the opportunity to have 2 stellar RVPs reporting to me who together managed approximately 25 enterprise AEs. At the time Appirio was pioneering crowdsourcing in the enterprise – not an easy feat given how new crowdsourcing was at the time PLUS we still had a diverse set of core practices to sell—SO naturally we needed a playbook! It was incredibly rewarding working on and rolling out a global playbook to support sales adoption and growth across all our business lines., Regional Vice President of Sales, Oct 2013 - Sep 2014 · 1 yr, Central Region, I stepped into the RVP of central role and it was go time. We had a great core team, but some big quota gaps. I took on multi-practice bookings responsibility – HCM, CRM, and Crowdsourcing and grew the sales team from 6 to 12 AEs. The biggest part of the role was finding and ramping sales talent. I pioneered an interviewing process which reduced AE ramp by 3 months. Fortunately, I was able attract and on-board some amazing new sellers - many who’ve become presidents club staples and/or have been promoted to leadership roles at Appirio. As a sales leader seeing your team successful is the most motivating part of the job- You work for your team! One individual in particular stands out – he was a top rep but had fallen to #25 when I took over the team. Together (mostly him with just coaching & cheerleading from me) we got him from #25 back to the top. We also made some major headway on the enterprise crowdsourcing front and did the largest deal to date from the region. With expectations from our partners changing and the need to create a lot more of our own demand, I started a demand generation (inside sales team) to increase market awareness and new pipeline. In 9 months grew the team from 1 to 8 people and generated $100M in influenced pipeline. I also stole a page from my old Ariba days and rolled out a customer relationship review process for key accounts in the region – this increased large program success and bookings from existing customers., Appirio ChalkTalk - Social @ Work, Being a social business is about more than monitoring Twitter, running Facebook ads and knowing what your customers ""like."" It's also about super-charging collaboration within your own company to break down hierarchies, increase idea flow, and drive innovation. To see how internal social helps companies, we need to examine at the way information and ideas currently flow within companies., Appirio ChalkTalk - Cloud Metrics for Salesforce.com, The cloud provides dramatic improvements over on-premise technology. Because of this benefit companies are now pursuing broader and more ambitious programs with the cloud. In order to take on these more complex and strategic initiatives, companies need visibility into the metrics of their cloud environments to de-risk them and ensure their cloud platforms continue to create more agile businesses., Welcome to the Internet of Customers, Behind all the apps, all the devices, all the technology, all the connections, is the most important element of all: your customers.

I loved the culture (core values are – customer, team and fun). It was also an incredibly unique opportunity to be a part of a small team that launched Appirio’s Human Capital Management practice (today it's our 2nd largest practice globally). So I made a leap and: • Built market awareness and channel partnerships • Created new offerings to differentiate Appirio’s solutions in the highly competitive HCM services space. For example: HCM Diagnostics & Business Impact Reporting, On-Demand Best Practice Subscription Services. • Achieved 150% of quota in 6 months • Landed 3 anchor accounts that continue to create revenue for Appirio • Created a highly successful field marketing strategy and approach was syndicated across all regions and practices at Appirio. , General Manager America's & Global CMO, Mar 2018 - Aug 2018 · 6 mos, Greater Chicago Area, Responsible for driving revenue growth across all our practices in the Americas.

For example: HCM Diagnostics & Business Impact Reporting, On-Demand Best Practice Subscription Services. • Achieved 150% of quota in 6 months • Landed 3 anchor accounts that continue to create revenue for Appirio • Created a highly successful field marketing strategy and approach was syndicated across all regions and practices at Appirio. , General Manager America's & Global CMO, Mar 2018 - Aug 2018 · 6 mos, Greater Chicago Area, Responsible for driving revenue growth across all our practices in the Americas.

It’s called a dream come true. I was part of a very small team of executives supporting Appirio’s acquisition process and took point on all internal and external communications across Appirio and Wipro. A major driver for Wipro’s desire to acquire Appirio was our brand and GTM. The cornerstone of our GTM was a big shift I lead with the help of my VP of brand. The cloud ecosystem had evolved--clients wanted more than just cloud technology, they wanted outcomes. As the SVP of marketing, I brought the entire marketing function under a consistent messaging platform centered around creating customer & worker experience outcomes. This provided focus, consistency, differentiation, and thrill of creating a category. It was a massive effort to overhaul all our assets while building critical mass of new ones to support the strategy. Thank goodness it worked! We saw win rates soar, deal sizes grow, and a big ROI lift across all our marketing programs. For example, we had 200% increase in A.V.E. (ad value equivalent) and 50% increase in spend ROI. Launching our thought leadership platform was not just a marketing effort though – I knew we could not do it alone. We had to start a movement! The first step in that movement was to win our sales team and the best way to get them jazzed is SKO. We dramatically up-leveled the SKO program, content, and energy level. We launched a certification program to make sure every field Appirian could confidently tell our new story. Next we took the show on the road with our first thought leadership tour. Executing a 6-city tour in partnership with sales, partners, and our customers. The program was so successful we've expanded it every year and it's a critical part of our marketing, sales and alliances program., Every tech start up dreams of “the successful exit”, imagine getting “the exit”, being an integral part of making it happen, and the acquisition being on record as one of the most successful in the space?!

It was an unexpected yet career defining move. As a recovering software sales gal one of the first things I did was establish quotas. This allowed us to really start to change the marketing culture and conversation to be much more ROI and results driven. The team stepped up and we dramatically increased sourced pipeline and generated 5X the ROI from our field programs. Coming from sales I could bridge the gap between marketing and sales to ensure our content machine was effective and relevant. We also established a much tighter partnership with sales around our biggest program – Dreamforce! Together we re-vamped preparation protocols, enablement, and onsite productivity tracking which yielded a 7X increase in ROI. Please don’t ask about the “snoop dogg situation” Let’s just say I weathered that crisis with the help of our CFO, VP of Comms, and General Council I continued to develop and grow our inside sale team and approach. We focused on going from an SDR program to a true inside sales quota bearing function. Last, I was fortunate enough to make my first trip to India. I was hosting a big customer visit and immediately realised what an amazing asset we had in Jaipur. We quickly created a marketing function in India to support a variety of demand generation activities. This gave us scale, time zone coverage, and an influx of energetic new Appirio marketers.

Our core value props are: 1.

"I am a highly accomplished SaaS and technology leader in Pre/Post Sales with over 15 years of software and technology experience in both startup and enterprise companies. My two passions are helping grow revenue for my company and helping my customer achieve ""true customer success"" by making sure they use the product to its fullest to drive business results.

I am currently at 6sense where I lead the Customer Success, Customer Experience, Platform Adoption and Sales Engineering team. Our vision is to build the best Customer Success org ever and customers recognize us as the company that provides the best Customer Experience they have ever  gotten from a B2b company. 

Prior to 6sense, I was at Naehas where I led GTM for the company. 

Prior to Naehas, I was at Oracle where I led the B2C practice within the Oracle Marketing Cloud, helping marketers understand why the OMC has the best stack in marketing across Responsys, Blue Kai, Maxymiser and Datalogix. I helped drive tremendous growth across North America.

Prior to Oracle, I was at Responsys from the early days to successful IPO to the acquisition by Oracle.  I helped grow revenues from under $20M to over $200M ARR. I helped bootstrap our APAC Sales teams in Australia, New Zealand and Japan and was closely involved in 100's of closed opportunities and dozens of $1M+ ARR deals spanning multiple verticals including Retail, Travel, Finance and Technology. 

Prior to that I worked at a startup BuildOnline (SaaS based document management, 200 people) where I led pre and post sales for North America. BuildOnline got acquired by CTSpace and Salesforce.com.

Prior to that I worked at Intellibank (20 people) where we grew the Customer footprint from 5 to 80 in under a year. Intellibank revolutionized the SaaS business by having CRM, Sales Automation, HR, Support, Proj Mgmt all under one platform.

Prior to that I worked for Rational Software which was a leader in developer tools. I came in to Rational through Pure Software/Pure Atria and the company grew from 200 people to 4000 people, $80M to $800M million during my tenure. We were acquired by IBM where I spent one year.","6sense, 5 yrs 1 mo, Chief Customer Officer, Full-time, Sep 2017 - Present · 4 yrs 11 mos, San Francisco Bay Area, 6sense is building the next-generation intelligent marketing cloud, empowering the world’s best marketing and sales organizations drive more revenue. 6sense's leading patent-protected platform powers all downstream sales and marketing systems with intelligence on who is in an active buying cycle, what products, when they will buy and where they are in the buyer's journey. 6sense enables intelligent growth resulting in new pipeline, higher marketing to sales conversions, larger opportunity size and increased sales productivity and effectiveness with teams focusing on the right buyers with a need now., Vice President Sales Engineering, Jul 2017 - Sep 2017 · 3 mos, San Francisco, CA, 6sense is building the next-generation intelligent marketing cloud, empowering the world’s best marketing and sales organizations drive more revenue. 6sense's leading patent-protected platform powers all downstream sales and marketing systems with intelligence on who is in an active buying cycle, what products, when they will buy and where they are in the buyer's journey. 6sense enables intelligent growth resulting in new pipeline, higher marketing to sales conversions, larger opportunity size and increased sales productivity and effectiveness with teams focusing on the right buyers with a need now. , 6Sense Leads Forester's Wave, 6Sense delivers 405% ROI, How 6Sense powers Dell's Marketing Stack, The US$67 billion takeover in 2016 by Austin-based technology maker, Dell, of its Boston-based rival, EMC¸ represented the largest merger in the technology industry.

"I am a highly accomplished SaaS and technology leader in Pre/Post Sales with over 15 years of software and technology experience in both startup and enterprise companies. My two passions are helping grow revenue for my company and helping my customer achieve ""true customer success"" by making sure they use the product to its fullest to drive business results.

I am currently at 6sense where I lead the Customer Success, Customer Experience, Platform Adoption and Sales Engineering team. Our vision is to build the best Customer Success org ever and customers recognize us as the company that provides the best Customer Experience they have ever  gotten from a B2b company. 

Prior to 6sense, I was at Naehas where I led GTM for the company. 

Prior to Naehas, I was at Oracle where I led the B2C practice within the Oracle Marketing Cloud, helping marketers understand why the OMC has the best stack in marketing across Responsys, Blue Kai, Maxymiser and Datalogix. I helped drive tremendous growth across North America.

Prior to Oracle, I was at Responsys from the early days to successful IPO to the acquisition by Oracle.  I helped grow revenues from under $20M to over $200M ARR. I helped bootstrap our APAC Sales teams in Australia, New Zealand and Japan and was closely involved in 100's of closed opportunities and dozens of $1M+ ARR deals spanning multiple verticals including Retail, Travel, Finance and Technology. 

Prior to that I worked at a startup BuildOnline (SaaS based document management, 200 people) where I led pre and post sales for North America. BuildOnline got acquired by CTSpace and Salesforce.com.

Prior to that I worked at Intellibank (20 people) where we grew the Customer footprint from 5 to 80 in under a year. Intellibank revolutionized the SaaS business by having CRM, Sales Automation, HR, Support, Proj Mgmt all under one platform.

Prior to that I worked for Rational Software which was a leader in developer tools. I came in to Rational through Pure Software/Pure Atria and the company grew from 200 people to 4000 people, $80M to $800M million during my tenure. We were acquired by IBM where I spent one year.","6sense, 5 yrs 1 mo, Chief Customer Officer, Full-time, Sep 2017 - Present · 4 yrs 11 mos, San Francisco Bay Area, 6sense is building the next-generation intelligent marketing cloud, empowering the world’s best marketing and sales organizations drive more revenue. 6sense's leading patent-protected platform powers all downstream sales and marketing systems with intelligence on who is in an active buying cycle, what products, when they will buy and where they are in the buyer's journey. 6sense enables intelligent growth resulting in new pipeline, higher marketing to sales conversions, larger opportunity size and increased sales productivity and effectiveness with teams focusing on the right buyers with a need now., Vice President Sales Engineering, Jul 2017 - Sep 2017 · 3 mos, San Francisco, CA, 6sense is building the next-generation intelligent marketing cloud, empowering the world’s best marketing and sales organizations drive more revenue. 6sense's leading patent-protected platform powers all downstream sales and marketing systems with intelligence on who is in an active buying cycle, what products, when they will buy and where they are in the buyer's journey. 6sense enables intelligent growth resulting in new pipeline, higher marketing to sales conversions, larger opportunity size and increased sales productivity and effectiveness with teams focusing on the right buyers with a need now. , 6Sense Leads Forester's Wave, 6Sense delivers 405% ROI, How 6Sense powers Dell's Marketing Stack, The US$67 billion takeover in 2016 by Austin-based technology maker, Dell, of its Boston-based rival, EMC¸ represented the largest merger in the technology industry.

"Hi, I’m Mike. And I want to talk about the digital divide between brands and their customers.

To back up a little, my experience with customer experience began with answering tens of thousands of customer service inquiries manually, firsthand. 

Using these insights, I set out to build a platform that put the benefits of AI into the hands of non-technical support teams who can then build, manage, and track ROI-driving automated customer experiences themselves. And Ada was born.

Ada's no-code brand interaction platform is the new front line of customer experience, empowering businesses to provide personalized experiences at scale. We work to bridge the divide between brand and consumer. We're automating billions of customer interactions for some of the fastest growing brands in the world. We've also been recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in North America, coming in at 15 on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™.

For my part, I’m a proud Canadian, and I'm committed to fostering and promoting our entrepreneurial ecosytem here. I’m also a distance runner and a Raptors fan. I’ve been recognized by Forbes 30 Under 30 and EY’s Entrepreneur of the Year program, and I’m a Fellow at the Creative Destruction Lab, which works to support early-stage science-based startups.

"I’ve always believed that People are People and not Resources. In my extensive career as a senior executive and as a management consultant I always saw myself as the Chief People Officer and not the Chief Human Resource Officer. 

This is an important distinction because it shapes the way we see the people we work with.

I’m a veteran of five IPO’s and have intimate experience with the opportunities and challenges that come when organizations go through significant transformation.

I use a term called Corporate Courage that identifies when a company or organization is able to put their people first, even in the midst of organizational disruption. It isn’t easy, but in my career working with some of the finest companies in the world, I’ve discovered that when an organization puts their people first, they are able to weather the challenges and emerge stronger than before because of the strength of their people.

I believe in humor and live by the philosophy that if I can see the punchline, I will see the solution;  and thus I default to comedy as the first approach in most situations.   

Sometimes, based upon my experience or my sense of humor, I am asked to speak to groups of people about a variety topics such as:  the future of work; the future of human resources, organizational dislocation; corporate courage; humor in the workplace; innovation and social consciousness in business.

I spend my time away from work trying to give back a bit and have participated in the Board of Regents at Holy Names College and Board of Advisors to the Cameron School of Business at UNCW.  One of the great joys of my life has been recognition for my contributions as a recipient of the 2014 ""Stevie Awards"" for Women in High Tech, by the Silicon Valley Business Journal in 2015 as one of the ""100 Women of Influence"" in Silicon Valley, and names on of the 2021 Top 100 HR Tech Influencers by HR Executive. 

But my greatest joy in life is my marriage to Kem Hauge an award winning composer, and our son Andy, his wife Ginger, and their children Drew and Charlotte.

"Just started as President and COO at DataRobot to lead Product, Engineering, Infosec, Marketing, and Strategy. Looking forward to exciting times ahead! 

Before joining DataRobot, I was VP/GM of Data Analytics services, including BigQuery, Dataflow, PubSub, Dataproc etc in Google Cloud (GCP). In this role, I was responsible for engineering, operations, and go-to-market, including overall P&L, of the Analytics business in GCP. 

This was a period of rapid growth for GCP Data Analytics. We launched innovative new services like BigQuery Omni, Dataplex, Data Fusion, Data Catalog to name a few. Data Analytics revenue grew 3x thanks to customers like Walmart, HSBC, Vodafone, PayPal, Twitter adopting BigQuery and other GCP services as their primary data analytics platform. 

Prior to joining Google, I led Database services at AWS. One of my proudest accomplishments at AWS is the development and launch of Amazon Aurora, a massively scalable relational database service re-imagined for the cloud. Aurora has transformed the way people think about mission-critical databases in the cloud and has been the fastest growing service in the history of AWS. In 2019, I was named one of the technology executive of the year for transforming database industry. I also led the development and launch of AWS Glue, a data integration and transformation service at the core of AWS Datalake. 

Prior to joining AWS, I held multiple executive and technical leadership positions in IBM, including a 2-year international assignment in Shanghai, China. One of my key accomplishments in IBM is the development of Storwize, a family of virtualizing storage controller, and growing it to a $1B/year business in less than four years. Earlier in my career, I was a Principal Engineer at Tellium, an optical networking pioneer, that I helped grow from an early stage start-up to a public company ($3B+ IPO).

I am a Fellow of the IEEE and a Distinguished Member of the ACM. I have co-authored a book, 50+ US patent applications, 100+ technical articles including award winning papers and major Internet standards. I received MS and PhD degrees from the University of Maryland, and a BTech from IIT, all in Computer Science.","President and COO, DataRobot, Feb 2022 - Present · 6 mos, San Francisco Bay Area, Just started as President and COO at DataRobot to lead Product, Engineering, Infosec, Marketing, and Strategy.
