"I build stuff - great teams, products, customers, and businesses.

I've been fortunate to be one of the first employees of a great company (Plumtree, 1997), and to have managed most of the functions there (QA, Engineering, Product Management, Program Management, UX, Support), learning a ton along the way.  I continued the journey at BEA (BEA acquired Plumtree in 2005),  but  had to jump off the train  when Oracle bought BEA.

I scoured SF for the right startup opportunity, but was convinced to build a 'startup' within SAP in 2008.  Yeah, I know.  But we built a Rails/Freemium/Cloud/Open/etc. collaborative glue called StreamWork that is still kicking today (as SAP JAM).  In the SAP journey I picked up large business experience with the BusinessObjects portfolio, and operated at scale.  But after 2.5 years it was time to get back to my roots.  To start pure and fresh.

I co-founded UniversityNow (unow.com) in May 2011, running Product, Engineering and UX.  Built a tiny team and created a groundbreaking open university system in 11 months, earning accolades from Gates Foundation and the Dept of Education, with a beautiful mission: students earned an accredited degree without any debt.  We made it pretty far but didn't find sustainable product market fit.

In 2013 I joined the team at OneLogin, pioneers in cloud identity management, and we grew from a small team into a real company over the last 4 years.  Running engineering and then product management, delivering a business critical cloud infrastructure to the most amazing customers in the world.

"I am an experienced organizational leader with a proven track record building outstanding teams and developing product and business strategies in high tech and the data space. I run business and GTM strategy at Sisense across all of our product lines, our strategic partnerships including with AWS and Snowflake, our cloud offering, and user research and product management teams in the US.  Previously, I built the product function as VP of Product at Periscope Data (acquired by Sisense in 2019), built Adobe’s Creative Cloud for enterprise and fully converted its customer base to an annual subscription business in under two years, enabled global sales teams to deliver on over $1Bn in annual enterprise and SMB revenue, and grew an early-stage startup (Electric Cloud, acquired by CloudBees) to over $10M ARR.

I bring over twenty-five years of engineering and product management expertise to the table, having built requirements with and delivered products to 4000+ major enterprise logos across a wide range of vertical markets.

I build teams, operating with 30+ product managers and 200+ software developers.  My teams follow a lean, business-oriented ethic, and when we find solutions to problems we prove it with evidence rather than simply leading with opinion.

My background is deeply technical – I earned an MS in Computer Science from UC Irvine and I worked as a developer for years before moving into product management.  I love navigating hard, gritty technology like SQL, Python, and ML – and I drive my product management teams to get their hands dirty and engage with their developers.","Sisense, 3 yrs 3 mos, Chief Strategy Officer, Full-time, Jun 2022 - Present · 2 mos, Reporting to the CEO, I quarterback all aspects of Sisense business and go to market strategy, drive messaging, analyst relations, pricing, GTM strategy, and M&A.
