"Every so often, we are fortunate enough to be presented with a priceless opportunity to innovate, differentiate and dramatically influence a profession and an industry.   My career continues to present itself with such open windows allowing me to build and lead teams, set strategy, and create scalable solutions.

I’ve been credited with being a results-oriented leader in part due to my extensive experience ranging from start-up to blue chip, and a diversity of industry not limited to high tech and mining.   I have lived in five countries and worked in three – all attributing to my strength as a global leader.   

I’m passionate about:

- working with insanely smart people who are purpose driven and committed to making a difference through the work they do;
- creating transformation by leveraging data.  Data tells the talent story…it’s the connective tissue woven throughout an employee lifecycle;
- keeping the eye on the bulls-eye.  Intentional focus moves us closer to vision. 

Specialties:  Global people strategies, scalable growth strategies, building and leading teams, performance management, change management, total rewards, executive coaching, employee relations 

What's important to me outside of work?  My family, running, French Champagne, delightful foods, traveling to unique parts of the world, and endless beaches.  I’d like to add climbing mountains and sky diving but will leave that to another life time.","Chief People Officer, Airtable · Full-time, May 2021 - Present · 1 yr 3 mos, San Francisco Bay Area, Chief People Officer, Pure Storage, Jan 2017 - May 2021 · 4 yrs 5 mos, San Francisco Bay Area, Since joining Pure, we have experienced incredible growth and scale by fundamentally changing the trajectory of data storage by pivoting to the digital era.

"“Focus is a choice, greatness is a decision, confidence is action.” Graham Betchart 

This quote inspires my constant pursuit to be better. Throughout my career, I have always pushed myself to take on roles that would make me uncomfortable at times to maximize learning through experience. I love the challenge to step up and deliver in the moments that matters most.

I’ve spent my early years focused on creating & incubating start-ups where challenges can seem insurmountable and yet the opportunities can seem unlimited. I learned the importance of having laser focus when entering new markets.

Next up was leading a large hyper growth business through the “tornado” stage of its business cycle. This experience taught me how to scale, integrate acquisitions, and the importance of hiring exceptional talent despite the business demands to fill roles quickly.

Later, I managed a multi-billion dollar business battling through a disruptive market transition. It was the classic ""innovators dilemma,” requiring tough portfolio decisions across diverse business stages—high growth, mainstream and declining product areas.

Doubling down on my passion for high growth businesses, I went back to my roots and founded another internal start-up in cognitive IT operations which Cisco accelerated with the acquisition of AppDynamics. At AppDynamics I led the marketing and strategy organization through the company’s hyper-growth stage on its path to become #1 in the market. 

Today, I lead product at People.ai, a hyper growth start-up that is unlocking the full potential of go-to-market teams to be at their best. Having used People.ai in my CMO role at AppDynamics, it was a game changer for me, and I am inspired to bring this powerful solution to others like me.

"At Rippling, we believe that fragmentation of employee information is the unacknowledged root cause of almost all the administrative work of running a company.

The right solution is to create a single system for employee data that sits, like a layer, underneath all your business software & services, and which pipes employee data, configuration instructions, and access rules into all of these systems. Most platforms focus on a narrow use case across one specific department's business systems,  but we automate onboarding, offboarding , and employee management across all every system that needs it.

In Rippling, you click a button to hire (or promote or terminate) and you're done: we generate agreements and paperwork for electronic signing, collect their personal info, ship them a pre-configured computer with security set up on day 1, set up their accounts in all your different business systems (Gsuite, Slack, Box, Salesforce, GitHub, AWS, etc.), set them up in payroll and benefits, and the list goes on.

Our Mission is simple: To eliminate the administrative drudgery of running a business by creating a single system of record for employee information that all business software and services plug into.","Customer Support, Rippling, Jun 2016 - Present · 6 yrs 2 mos, Co-Founder and CEO, Zenefits, Sep 2012 - Feb 2016 · 3 yrs 6 mos, San Francisco Bay Area, SigFig, 2 yrs 2 mos, Co-Founder, Board Member, Jan 2011 - Feb 2013 · 2 yrs 2 mos, President, Head of Product, Jan 2011 - Jul 2012 · 1 yr 7 mos, As one of two SigFig co-founders, I managed the product, design, and financial data / sync teams for the largest online financial advisor by AUM.
