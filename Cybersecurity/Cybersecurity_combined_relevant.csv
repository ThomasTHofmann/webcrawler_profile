"I lucked into technology. As a Cal English Lit grad interviewing for an editing job in my native Bay Area, I was told I could join the staff of LAN Magazine. “Land?” I replied. “As in real estate?” “No, LAN – as in Local Area Network.” Um ... what’s a network?

So started my sequence of technical learning curves. As a tech journalist and analyst my first 9 working years, I got to cover an endless stream of new technologies – and meet the amazing luminaries inventing them and the passionate customers using them. I had to absorb ideas quickly, analyze their impact, and then communicate back the value prop to our magazine readers and consulting clients.

And I loved it – all of it. The constant “new thing,” the daily learning curve, the pace of change, distilling and sharing. Changing over to the vendor side brought the added joy of truly being part of a team building and delivering amazing stuff. I found that in startup after startup, I thrived on the fast pace, the controlled chaos, the need to decide quickly and then iterate. As my marketing responsibilities have grown, and marketing success has increasingly depended on a blend of the analytical and creative, I have loved bringing that fast learning and constant iteration to the worlds of demand gen and pipeline, equipping our sales guys, delivering awesome content, and sharing the value of what we do with the larger world.

I got into tech through luck. I’ve stayed because I love it.","Vice President Marketing, Salt Security · Full-time, Oct 2020 - Present · 1 yr 10 mos, First marketing leader building on the awesome momentum this Gartner Cool Vendor and API security pioneer has already created.

"As CEO of Snyk, I have the pleasure of leading a worldwide organization that is disrupting the security industry.  

I love what I do. This may not be something you often hear a CEO say, but it captures my feelings. I get  to work with great people all around the world who bring their own skills and passion to their roles. I've been able to learn from them, work with them, and share in our mutual success. 

There are three basic principles I follow as a leader: 
1.	Lead by example. It is important for me to know that others can look to me with confidence that I will do my best across all endeavors. I expect others in my organization to lead by example as well. “Do as I say not as I do” does not cut it.
2.	Always be learning and pushing myself. I try never to become complacent or too comfortable. I challenge all our employees to continually learn and seek to improve.  
  3.	Take risks and push beyond your comfort levels. If you find yourself too comfortable in your role, and there is no longer any challenge, it’s time to move on. Raise your hand and ask for something new. 

I like to lead people who are hungry, humble, and smart. 
	Hungry because they are always striving to be better
	Humble because they know they can’t do it alone and can work with a team
	Smart because I want to work with people who can teach me to be better

The world is transforming around us in every way. It is hard to predict what will happen and we often can’t control where the changes will come from. But what we can control and what we can predict is how we are going to respond. 

It is an exciting time for organizations of all sizes as change brings opportunity. I’m honored that I have the chance to lead Snyk and have an impact on the lives of customers, partners, and employees.

"As a constant student of SaaS metrics and emerging SaaS business models, I have enjoyed 20 years working with venture-based businesses and wonderful people all over the world.  Starting a business, building a team and organization of creative and passionate people all aligned on a vision and goal is truly an amazing experience that never gets old.

I am a Chartered Public Accountant (CPA), having started my career with PwC before joining Watchfire, my first start-up.  Watchfire was an amazing experience in the early 2000’s.   While at Watchfire, we raised venture capital, grew the team to 200 people, signed customer contracts with Fortune 500 companies and ultimately entered into an M&A transaction with IBM.  From there I went on to repeat this dynamic and amazing experience with Third Brigade, Desktone, Recognia and Shoebox and now currently at Snyk.

I am a road runner, but generally love all things outside.  Whether it is jogging with my wife, or friends at work, or hiking or snowshoeing in the woods, getting the circulation going and breathing in the sites and fresh air is second to none for keeping it real.","CFO, Snyk, Jan 2019 - Present · 3 yrs 7 mos, London, United Kingdom, Serving in a part-time role with the company since it was founded in 2015, I joined the team full time in 2019.

"I am the Chief Revenue Officer for Snyk. We are the leader in developer security. We empower the world's developers to build secure applications and equip security teams to meet the demands of the digital world.

Since the start of my career to today, I have lived by a simple mantra. If we focus on our customer and ensure we meet and exceed their expectations, “we all win”. Since the world has transitioned to an always on, cloud and SaaS first approach to business software, how I think about leading go-to-market teams has evolved. Gone are the days of software “shelf ware”. As an industry there is no apatite to tolerate this anymore…Cloud and SaaS have changed this forever. The consumerization of business software and the fact the world is rapidly modernizing their businesses via digital transformation means we need to think differently in supporting our customers. I think about the fact that technology now innovates at rapid speeds. As a result, customers need and want continuous value and best in class outcomes. To support the technology pairing the right go-to-market resources throughout the lifecycle of the “customer|supplier” relationship is really where the magic happens to create world class scale AND world class continuous outcomes for customers. Helping think about, lead and solving these challenges is what gets me excited to come to work every day. 

All of this can’t be done without ensuring key supporting stakeholders are aligned to this mission. Partners and Employees that bring this to life need to be supported and enabled to make this a reality. As Richard Branson says, “Employees come first. If you take care of employees, they will take care of clients.” Ultimately, I am here to lead, guide, support and serve the team that I lead and the partners that help bring the possible to life with our customers. 

I joined Snyk because the problem we are solving a critical one for the world to solve.  Software is everywhere and we need to make it easier and more effective to secure it. If you are excited about this simple yet powerful mission, come join a company that has the brainpower and people power to bring this to life for our customers!","Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), Snyk · Full-time, Oct 2021 - Present · 10 mos, Boston, Massachusetts, United States, Mimecast, 5 yrs 3 mos, Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), Sep 2019 - Oct 2021 · 2 yrs 2 mos, Greater Boston Area, Senior Vice President, North America, Aug 2016 - Sep 2019 · 3 yrs 2 mos, Greater Boston Area, Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), Sep 2019 - Oct 2021 · 2 yrs 2 mos, Greater Boston Area, Senior Vice President, North America, Aug 2016 - Sep 2019 · 3 yrs 2 mos, Greater Boston Area, Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), Sep 2019 - Oct 2021 · 2 yrs 2 mos, Greater Boston Area, Senior Vice President, North America, Aug 2016 - Sep 2019 · 3 yrs 2 mos, Greater Boston Area, RSA, The Security Division of EMC, 7 yrs 4 mos, Vice President, Americas, Jul 2015 - Aug 2016 · 1 yr 2 mos, Area Vice-President US East and Canada, Jan 2015 - Jun 2015 · 6 mos, Greater Boston Area, Area Vice-President, US Commercial Sales, Feb 2013 - Jan 2015 · 2 yrs, Greater Boston Area, Country Manager, Canada, May 2009 - Feb 2013 · 3 yrs 10 mos, Toronto, Canada Area, Vice President, Americas, Jul 2015 - Aug 2016 · 1 yr 2 mos, Area Vice-President US East and Canada, Jan 2015 - Jun 2015 · 6 mos, Greater Boston Area, Area Vice-President, US Commercial Sales, Feb 2013 - Jan 2015 · 2 yrs, Greater Boston Area, Country Manager, Canada, May 2009 - Feb 2013 · 3 yrs 10 mos, Toronto, Canada Area, Vice President, Americas, Jul 2015 - Aug 2016 · 1 yr 2 mos, Area Vice-President US East and Canada, Jan 2015 - Jun 2015 · 6 mos, Greater Boston Area, Area Vice-President, US Commercial Sales, Feb 2013 - Jan 2015 · 2 yrs, Greater Boston Area, Country Manager, Canada, May 2009 - Feb 2013 · 3 yrs 10 mos, Toronto, Canada Area, Dell EMC, 4 yrs 10 mos, Enteprise Account Executive, Jan 2006 - May 2009 · 3 yrs 5 mos, Calgary, Canada Area, Commercial Account Executive, Aug 2004 - Dec 2005 · 1 yr 5 mos, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Enteprise Account Executive, Jan 2006 - May 2009 · 3 yrs 5 mos, Calgary, Canada Area, Commercial Account Executive, Aug 2004 - Dec 2005 · 1 yr 5 mos, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Enteprise Account Executive, Jan 2006 - May 2009 · 3 yrs 5 mos, Calgary, Canada Area, Commercial Account Executive, Aug 2004 - Dec 2005 · 1 yr 5 mos, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Account Executive - Preferred Accounts Division , Dell, Feb 2001 - Apr 2004 · 3 yrs 3 mos, Calgary, Canada Area, Account Manager, Xerox, Jan 2000 - Jan 2001 · 1 yr 1 mo, Toronto, Canada Area","Wilfrid Laurier University, Honours Business Administration BBA, Business/Commerce, General, Ashbury College","Solution Selling, Enterprise Software, Cloud Computing, SaaS, Salesforce.com, Sentinel Source"

"In my role here at Snyk and my previous roles I’ve led global business and corporate development in emerging and hyper-growth software companies. In these positions, as technology continuously changes, I've worked closely with my team leaders, developers, and providers to adapt and change as well.

I know that teamwork is the one sure way to reach the maximum potential within a company and navigate an increasingly complex world. Focusing on a team-centric approach helps me to ensure our ability to adapt to the many threats and challenges faced by our customers in this modern digital environment.

I’ve seen firsthand the wonders of teamwork as we continue to experience massive growth and innovation. The best way to describe the teams at Snyk is this quote by Amy Edmondson from the book Team of Teams:

“Great teams consist of individuals who have learned to trust each other. Over time, they have discovered each other’s strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to play as a coordinated whole.”","SVP, Global Business & Corporate Development, Snyk · Full-time, Nov 2019 - Present · 2 yrs 9 mos, Greater Boston Area, VP, Global Business & Corporate Development, Veeam Software, Aug 2017 - Dec 2019 · 2 yrs 5 mos, Boston, MA, VMware, 3 yrs 11 mos, Sr. Director, System Integrators and Strategic Outsourcing - AMER, Apr 2016 - Aug 2017 · 1 yr 5 mos, Greater Boston Area, Senior Director, EUC, Oct 2013 - Mar 2016 · 2 yrs 6 mos, Sr. Director, System Integrators and Strategic Outsourcing - AMER, Apr 2016 - Aug 2017 · 1 yr 5 mos, Greater Boston Area, Senior Director, EUC, Oct 2013 - Mar 2016 · 2 yrs 6 mos, Sr. Director, System Integrators and Strategic Outsourcing - AMER, Apr 2016 - Aug 2017 · 1 yr 5 mos, Greater Boston Area, Senior Director, EUC, Oct 2013 - Mar 2016 · 2 yrs 6 mos, Vice President of Business Development, Desktone, Inc., Apr 2011 - Oct 2013 · 2 yrs 7 mos, Rational Software logo, WW Executive Business Development, IBM Rational Software, Aug 2007 - May 2011 · 3 yrs 10 mos, Watchfire logo, Watchfire Corp, 7 yrs 8 mos, VP of Business Development & Channel Sales, Jul 2000 - Aug 2007 · 7 yrs 2 mos, VP of Business development, 2000 - 2007 · 7 yrs, VP of Business Development & Channel Sales, Jul 2000 - Aug 2007 · 7 yrs 2 mos, VP of Business development, 2000 - 2007 · 7 yrs, VP of Business Development & Channel Sales, Jul 2000 - Aug 2007 · 7 yrs 2 mos, VP of Business development, 2000 - 2007 · 7 yrs, EVP of Business & Corporate Development, Corel Corporation, May 1991 - Aug 2000 · 9 yrs 4 mos, EVP of Business Development and Legal Affairs, Corel Systems, 1991 - 2000 · 9 yrs",University of Ottawa,"Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Strategic Partnerships, Solution Selling, Product Management, Acquisitions, Patents, SaaS, Salesforce.com, Patent Enforcement, Channel"

"In my career in the tech industry, I have seen success, failure, and disruptive change. By combining these experiences with the advice of mentors, I follow five principles:

1. I associate with great people – When you are around honest, hard-working, intellectually curious, and fun people you become a better person.
2. I join impressive companies – I look to organizations that are established industry leaders or promising start-ups.
3. I recognize that I am paid to learn – In every role I look for ways to grow in order to add value to my team and organization. I believe when you stop learning, you stop adding value.
4. I limit change to advance – When making career moves I attempt to hold at least one variable constant: the company, the general role, or the manager.
5. I take sole responsibility for my career – I believe the only person who truly cares about your career is you. I work to identify new responsibilities, new roles, and new ways to contribute to my team and my company.
 
Guided by these principles, I have had an exciting career in investment banking, management consulting and within technology companies themselves; building a general management skill set in finance, strategy, operations, human resources, and enablement. Being a part of Snyk, when viewed through this lens, is an easy and clear choice.","Vice President, Strategy and Operations, Snyk, 2020 - Present · 2 yrs 7 mos, Greater Boston, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Operations, Veeam Software, 2016 - 2020 · 4 yrs, Baar, Zug, Switzerland & Greater Boston, Veeam is the leader in backup, recovery and data management solutions that deliver Modern Data Protection. Veeam provide a single platform for Cloud, Virtual, Physical, SaaS and Kubernetes environments.
